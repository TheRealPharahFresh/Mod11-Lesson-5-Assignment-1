#Mod11-Lesson-5-Assignment-1

Description: I created a HomePage component as the main entry point and a **NotFound** page to handle invalid routes. The HomePage serves as the default view, while the **NotFound** page ensures users see a clear 404 error message with a full-width image and a button to navigate home. I used React Router for routing and **Bootstrap** for styling, applying **flex utilities** for centering, fluid containers for responsiveness, and **buttons with spacing classes** to enhance user experience and accessibility.
